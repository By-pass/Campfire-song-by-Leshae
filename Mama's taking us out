Mama's taking us out
(My version of Mama's takiny us to the zoo)

(my verse)
Mama's taking us out tomorrow
Where tomorrow?
Where tomorrow?
Mama's taking us out tomorrow
We can stay all day.

(original chorous)
We're going to the zoo, zoo, zoo
How about you, you, you?
You can come too, too, too
We're going to the zoo, zoo, zoo.

(orignial verse)
See all the monkeys scritch scritch scratchin'
Jumpin' all around and scritch scritch scratchin'
Hangin' by their long tails scritch scritch scratchin'
We can stay all day.
