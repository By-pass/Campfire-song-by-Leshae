Mama's taking us to the jungle
(My version of Mama's taking us to the zoo)

(first verse altered)
Mama's taking us to the jungle tomorrow
Where tomorrow?
Where tomorrow?
Mama's taking us to the jungle tomorrow
We can stay all day

(chorus)
We're going to the jungle, jungle, jungle
How about you, you, you?
You can come too, too, too
We're going to the jungle, jungle, jungle

(orignial verse)
See all the monkeys scritch scritch scratchin'
Jumpin' all around and scritch scritch scratchin'
Hangin' by their long tails scritch scritch scratchin'
We can stay all day.

(chorus)
We're going to the jungle, jungle, jungle
How about you, you, you?
You can come too, too, too
We're going to the jungle, jungle, jungle

(original verse)
See the elephant with the long trunk swingin'
Great big ears and long trunk swingin'
Sniffin' up peanuts with the long trunk swingin'
We can stay all day.

(chorus)
We're going to the jungle, jungle, jungle
How about you, you, you?
You can come too, too, too
We're going to the jungle, jungle, jungle

(my verse)
See the panther sneak, sneak, sneakin'
Hiddin' here and there sneak, sneak, sneakin'
Watchin' it's prey sneak, snaek, sneakin'
We can stay all day

(chorus)
We're going to the jungle, jungle, jungle
How about you, you, you?
You can come too, too, too
We're going to the jungle, jungle, jungle

(my verse)
See all the birds flap, flap , falpin'
High up flap, flap, flain'
colourful feathers flap, flap, flapin'
We can stay all day
